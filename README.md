How the Game Works

The game board is a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on the board.
The game ends when one player has three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when the board is full.
The player who achieves three symbols in a row first wins the game. If the board is full and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
